# Regression tests for the narration gate's drift rule.
#
# The rule has to survive a real asymmetry: an ASR mangles unusual names, so
# exact word-matching produces false alarms — and, worse, a *dropped* word
# scores as more similar than two mispronounced ones. So the gate measures
# missing/invented CONTENT, and these tests pin that distinction.
#
# Usage: tests/test-narrate.sh
