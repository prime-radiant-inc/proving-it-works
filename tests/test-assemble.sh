# Regression tests for scripts/assemble and scripts/make-subtitles.
#
# The property that matters: a segment lasts max(narration, visuals), and
# the scene offsets written for the subtitler match where scenes actually
# start in the finished cut. Hand-computed offsets silently mistime every
# cue after an inserted scene, which is why assemble emits them.
#
# Usage: tests/test-assemble.sh
